The $4 million canopy trail, the longest in the western United States, rises more than 100 feet above the forest floor in Eureka’s Sequoia Park, a 65-acre community forest that features trees rivaling those of nearby Redwood National Park and the Avenue of the Giants. The quarter-mile sky walk, most of it ADA compliant, is included with admission to Eureka&#8217;s Sequoia Park Zoo, the oldest certified zoo in the state of California.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before or after you venture into the redwoods, Old Town Eureka is a must-see.  Restaurants, galleries, theaters, coffee houses, boardwalks and antique shops make up only a portion of everything this cozy quaint Victorian town has to offer. The arts are very much alive in Old Town Eureka from the renowned Native American wing in the Clarke Historical Museum to the murals that adorn the walls of buildings in the area.  Experience Eureka’s history on walking tours or take in the sights while relaxing in the back seat of a horse-drawn carriage.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Put on your waterproof shoes and head over to the Humboldt Bay Wildlife Refuge. Located on the southernmost end of Humboldt Bay, the Wildlife Refuge is a great place to walk flat land trails, see wildlife, and explore wetland habitats. Typically, the best time to view the wildlife is at dawn and dusk but will depend on the tide levels. If you are new to bird watching, beginners can sign out a backpack kit with binoculars, birding guides, and other educational materials.</span></p>
